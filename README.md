## About Gabbro

>For the moment, Gabbro works only on **MacOs**, binaries compatible with other platforms will arrive soon!

## Installation

### Setting up the CLI

To get started, you must download the lastest published binary of the application : 

**[Download the Gabbro binary](https://github.com/akecel/gabbro/releases/latest/download/gabbro)**

Then put the binary in your `$HOME/bin` directory and, if it's not already done, add `$HOME/bin` to your `$PATH`.

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

Before we go, we still have one more step üòâ
### Configuration

You will now have to create crendentials for the **IGDB API** that you will put in the configuration file.

To do this, follow these steps :
- Sign Up with [Twitch](https://dev.twitch.tv/login) for a free account.
- Ensure you have Two Factor Authentication [enabled](https://www.twitch.tv/settings/security).
- Register your application in the [Twitch Developer Portal](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps/create).
- [Manage](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps) your newly created application.
- Generate a Client Secret by pressing [New Secret].
- Take note of the Client ID and Client Secret.

Once this is done, you can create a `gabbro.yaml` file in your `$HOME/bin` folder.

```yaml
client-id: "your-client-id"
access-token: "your-access-token"
```

You can verify that the CLI is properly installed and configured by using this command:

```bash
‚ùØ gabbro
